Hello.

We are happy to release the next version of our stable branch, pvpgn
1.8.1. This is another huge bug fixing release including fixes for
some very nasty bugs (easily reproduced bugs that can crash pvpgn).
All users of previous versions should update.

Subject: [Pvpgn-pkg] PvPGN 1.99.r324 Released!
Message-ID: <cc416a620708170736j5144eb14jbf9153261470dfcf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

PvPGN development progress has been slow as of late but in the long
time since we started the 1.99.x development branch many things
changed some of which being very nice (such as optimizations for very
big servers). Most of our focus on 1.99.x is to convert the code base
to a proper C++ version, then modularize to better support new
protocols and of course add new gaming protocols. For the curious
types that are too lazy to fetch the code from the SVN repository we
offer this snapshot. It should mostly work but it may also break as
it's a development snapshot. Report bugs on the bug tracker as usual.
Do not expect win32 binary packages too soon tho. And if you find the
version strange, it's just the SVN repository number at the moment of
release, it helps us developers when tracking buggy code changes.

As for a changelog, we don't have one complete right now so I can't
provide one. Assume that everything has changed between 1.8.x and
1.99.x (although most has not heh).
